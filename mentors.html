						<h2>Medical Mentors</h2>
					</header>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Connor Woodward. I am originally from Seattle, Washington. I am finishing up my first year of medical school and am interested in many different medical specialties including cancer and neuroscience. I have had many jobs in the past working with teenagers, trying to inspire them to make good choices in the future. I have always loved working with teenagers because they have their whole future ahead of them and are at such a crucial point in their lives. I also love their energy and excitement about life. Working in Junior Researchers has been a great experience for me, and I have been inspired by the teenagers I have met in the program.</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Fatima Yadudu. I am an international student from ___. I have been involved with this program since I arrived at the University of Kentucky. It is very important to me that we start to educate our young people about the sciences and help them to reach their full potential. It is important that we do not just try to selfishly advance ourselves without providing groundwork for the students of the future.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Alex Kingsbury. I am from ___ and decided to come to the Univeristy of Kentucky for my medical school years. After I identified Dr. Winkler as my chosen mentor I learned of all the work being done in this program which really inspired me to become a mentor. I love teaching our students about the things I have learned in medical school which will really give them a leg up in understanding the sciences.</p>

						<h2>Undergraduate Mentors</h2>
					</header>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Ashley Pittman and I'm from a suburb north of Chicago called Zion, IL. I'm a senior here at the University of Kentucky majoring in Medical Laboratory Science on a Pre-Med track. Through shadowing I have found interest in specialties such as Radiology, Otolaryngology, Urology, and Hematology. Junior Researchers is important to me because I am allowed the opportunity to work with a group of bright and intelligent high school students. Being a mentor its most important that I share personal encounters, allowing students to learn from my experiences. This program allows diverse minority students the opportunity to experience health care first hand and put them on the first track to pursing their interest in medicine.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Carine Malekera. I am a third year pre med undergraduate student in the College of Public Health and the College of Health Sciences. I plan on earning my MD/MPH degree in the next few years and pursue a career in medicine. I am originally from Bukavu, DR. Congo but I've lived in Lexington for many years. Junior Researchers is a great program that gives under represented minority students a chance to get ahead and start research in a medical setting. This exposure is one that helps foster a life long passion for medicine and the medical sciences. While teaching them the importance of mentorship and helping others reach their potential. This program is important to me because it gives minority students a chance to be successful in such a competitive field. </p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Kevin Landwehr, I am a senior undergraduate student in the College of Engineering Cmoputer Science program. Lexington has been my home for many years and I am always looking for ways to be more activly involved in the community. Though my appearence doesn't suggest it I am actually a Latino-American student so minortiy focused program like the Gill Junior Researchers is very near and dear to me. It is really an inspiration knowing that we can do something to help the next generation of students be even more prepared than we were for college and to help them matriculate to STEM specific fields is really an indication of the potential within our students. I am very excited to see where this program can take our students next!</p>
